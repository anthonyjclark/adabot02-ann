abstract="The paper describes experience with applying a user-centric design methodology in developing systems for human-robot teaming in Urban Search and Rescue. A human-robot team consists of several semi-autonomous robots (rovers/UGVs, microcopter/UAVs), several humans at an off-site command post (mission commander, UGV operators) and one on-site human (UAV operator). This system has been developed in close cooperation with several rescue organizations, and has been deployed in a real-life tunnel accident use case. The human-robot team jointly explores an accident site, communicating using a multi-modal team interface, and spoken dialogue. The paper describes the development of this complex socio-technical system per se, as well as recent experience in evaluating the performance of this system.",

abstract={Inspired by animals' ability to learn and adapt to changes in their environment during life, hybrid evolutionary algorithms have been developed and successfully applied in a number of research areas. This paper explores the effects of learning combined with a genetic algorithm to evolve control system parameters for a four-legged robot. Here, learning corresponds to the application of a local search algorithm on individuals during evolution. Two types of learning were implemented and tested, i.e. Baldwinian and Lamarckian learning. On the direct results from evolution in simulation, Lamarckian learning showed promising results, with a significant increase in final fitness compared with the results from evolution without learning. Further experiments with learning on the real robot demonstrated an efficient adaptation of the robot gait to the real world environment, and increased the performance to the level measured in simulation. This paper demonstrates that Lamarckian evolution is effective in improving the performance of robot controller evolution, and that the same learning process on the physical robot efficiently reduces the negative impact of the simulation-reality gap.},

abstract={Differential evolution (DE) is arguably one of the most powerful stochastic real-parameter optimization algorithms in current use. DE operates through similar computational steps as employed by a standard evolutionary algorithm (EA). However, unlike traditional EAs, the DE-variants perturb the current-generation population members with the scaled differences of randomly selected and distinct population members. Therefore, no separate probability distribution has to be used for generating the offspring. Since its inception in 1995, DE has drawn the attention of many researchers all over the world resulting in a lot of variants of the basic algorithm with improved performance. This paper presents a detailed review of the basic concepts of DE and a survey of its major variants, its application to multiobjective, constrained, large scale, and uncertain optimization problems, and the theoretical studies conducted on DE so far. Also, it provides an overview of the significant engineering applications that have benefited from the powerful nature of DE.},

Mechanisms in its design permit it to move over various terrains and climb over small obstacles in a manner similar to a cockroach. It uses one motor for propulsion and two small servos for steering. Its appendages, called whegs, consist of three evenly spaced spokes. Passive compliance in its axles permits its nominal tripod gait to adapt to irregular terrain and evolve to co-activation for climbing. Basic locomotion control is implemented in its, mechanical design. A benefit of this mechanical simplicity is that its control system is also simplified. Drawbacks to the simplifications include the inability to change the body's posture and decrease overhead clearance. Some of these problems will be addressed in future versions without compromising the basic design.},

Empirically stable and highly maneuverable locomotion arises from a very simple clock-driven, open-loop tripod gait. The legs rotate full circle, thereby preventing the common problem of toe stubbing in the protraction (swing) phase. An extensive suite of experimental results documents the robot’s significant “intrinsic mobility”—the traversal of rugged, broken, and obstacle-ridden ground without any terrain sensing or actively controlled adaptation. RHex achieves fast and robust forward locomotion traveling at speeds up to one body length per second and traversing height variations well exceeding its body clearance. },

  abstract  = {For disaster mitigation as well as for urban search and rescue (USAR) missions, it is often necessary to place sensors or cameras into dangerous or inaccessible areas to get a better situation awareness for the rescue personnel, before they enter a possibly dangerous area. Robots are predestined to this task, but the requirements for such mobile systems are demanding. They should be quick and agile and, at the same time, be able to deal with rough terrain and even to climb stairs. The latter is always required if the rescue personnel has to get access to higher floors inside a building. A rugged, waterproof and dust-proof corpus, and, if possible, the ability to swim, are only a few of many requirements for such robots. With those requirements in mind, the hybrid legged-wheeled robot ASGUARD was developed. This robot is able to cope with stairs, very rough terrain, and is able to move fast on flat ground. We will describe a versatile adaptive controller, based only on proprioceptive data. An additional inclination feedback is used to make the controller versatile for flat ground as well as for steep slopes and stairs. An attachable float provided, the robot is able to swim, using the same locomotion approach. By using twenty compliant legs, which are mounted around four individually rotating hip-shafts, we use an abstract model of quadruped locomotion. For the control design, four independent pattern generators are used. In contrast to many other hybrid legged-wheeled robots, we use the direct proprioceptive feedback in order to modify the internal control loop, thus adapting the model of the motion pattern. For difficult terrains, like slopes and stairs, we use a phase-adaptive approach which is using directly the proprioceptive data from the legs.},

In addition, we demonstrate that rotational dynamics become critical for stability as the scale of a robotic system is reduced. We present a new method of experimental dynamic tuning for legged millirobots, aimed at finding stable limit cycles with minimal rotational energy. By implementing an aerodynamic rotational damper, we further reduced the rotational energy in the system, and demonstrated that stable limit cycles with lower rotational energy are more robust to disturbances. This method increased the stability of the system without detracting from forward speed.},

abstract={The mobility of a wheeled robot in various terrains is basically limited by the size of the wheel. If the size of the wheel is fixed, the robot can only pass through a hole bigger than the wheel size. Furthermore, the robot cannot climb stairs much higher than the wheel size. Therefore, for a wheeled robot that has fixed dimensions, it is hard to improve the mobility depending on unexpected situations such as passing through a hole smaller than the original robot size and climbing stairs much higher than the original wheel size. To deal with the scale problem, we propose a deformable wheeled robot that can change the shape of the wheel depending on the obstacles. It improves the mobility the wheeled robot. In order to make the simple and robust robot, we employ smart structures and actuators such as composite flexure linkages, deformable polymers and shape memory alloy actuators. The robot shows three kinds of motion with combination of the motor and the SMA coil actuator. The motor is used for driving the wheel and the SMA coil actuators deform the wheel to produce a caterpillar-like motion. Using both actuators, the legged wheel motion can be produced. The light weight and the multimodal locomotion of the robot enhance the mobility for the search and rescue robot application.},

We propose the necessary conditions for stable dynamic walking on irregular terrain in general, and we design the mechanical system and the neural system by comparing biological concepts with those necessary conditions described in physical terms. A PD controller at the joints can construct the virtual spring-damper system as the visco-elasticity model of a muscle. The neural system model consists of a central pattern generator (CPG) and reflexes. A CPG receives sensory input and changes the period of its own active phase. The desired angle and P-gain of each joint in the virtual spring-damper system is switched based on the phase signal of the CPG. CPGs, the motion of the virtual spring-damper system of each leg and the rolling motion of the body are mutually entrained through the rolling motion feedback to CPGs, and can generate adaptive walking. We report on our experimental results of dynamic walking on terrains of medium degrees of irregularity in order to verify the effectiveness of the designed neuro-mechanical system. We point out the trade-off problem between the stability and the energy consumption in determining the cyclic period of walking on irregular terrain, and we show one example to solve this problem.

    abstract = { Over the last two decades the research and development of legged locomotion robots has grown steadily. Legged systems present major advantages when compared with ‘traditional’ vehicles, because they allow locomotion in inaccessible terrain to vehicles with wheels and tracks. However, the robustness of legged robots, and especially their energy consumption, among other aspects, still lag behind mechanisms that use wheels and tracks. Therefore, in the present state of development, there are several aspects that need to be improved and optimized. Keeping these ideas in mind, this paper presents the review of the literature of different methods adopted for the optimization of the structure andlocomotion gaits of walking robots. Among the distinct possible strategies often used for these tasks are referred approaches such as the mimicking of biological animals, the use of evolutionary schemes to find the optimal parameters and structures, the adoption of sound mechanical design rules, and the optimization of power-based indexes. }

abstract={We report on the design, optimization, and performance evaluation of a new wheel-leg hybrid robot. This robot utilizes a novel transformable wheel that combines the advantages of both circular and legged wheels. To minimize the complexity of the design, the transformation process of the wheel is passive, which eliminates the need for additional actuators. A new triggering mechanism is also employed to increase the transformation success rate. To maximize the climbing ability in legged-wheel mode, the design parameters for the transformable wheel and robot are tuned based on behavioral analyses. The performance of our new development is evaluated in terms of stability, energy efficiency, and the maximum height of an obstacle that the robot can climb over. With the new transformable wheel, the robot can climb over an obstacle 3.25 times as tall as its wheel radius, without compromising its driving ability at a speed of 2.4 body lengths/s with a specific resistance of 0.7 on a flat surface.},

abstract={A novel leg-wheel robot, Transleg, is proposed in this paper. Differing from the existing leg-wheel robots, Transleg is driven by wire, so the transmission mechanism is simple and the weight is reduced. Transleg adopts a transformable leg-wheel mechanism which has two degrees of freedom in the legged mode and one degree of freedom in the wheeled mode. The motions in and switching between the two modes are achieved by the same actuators. That is to say only two actuators are needed in one leg-wheel mechanism. The spine contributes significantly to the motion of the quadrupeds, so a compliant spine mechanism is designed for Transleg, which is actuated by two actuators and can bend in yaw and pitch directions. The leg-wheel and spine mechanisms and their kinematic analysis are described in this paper. To verify the feasibility of the leg-wheel mechanisms, the motions of Transleg without spine bending in legged and wheeled modes and switching between the two modes are simulated. Experiments on the motion of the prototype of the leg-wheel and spine mechanisms are also performed to validate the effectiveness of the two proposed mechanisms.},

abstract={This report is on the design, control strategy, implementation, and performance evaluation of a novel leg–wheel transformable robot called TurboQuad, which can perform fast gait/mode coordination and transitions in wheeled mode, in legged trotting, and in legged walking while in motion. This functionality was achieved by including two novel setups in the robot that were not included in its predecessor, Quattroped. First, a new leg–wheel mechanism was used, in which the leg/wheel operation and its in situ transition can be driven by the same set of motors, so the actuation system and power can be utilized efficiently. Second, a bio-inspired control strategy was applied based on the central pattern generator and coupled oscillator networks, in which the gait/mode generation, coordination, and transitions can be integrally controlled. The robot was empirically built and its performances in the described three gaits/modes as well as the transitions among them were experimentally evaluated and will be discussed in this paper.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel wheeled robot that transforms from a circled configuration to a spoke-like legged configuration. Wheeled mobile robots are able to quickly and efficiently move on flat surfaces. However they may sink into a terrain with dynamic surface such as snow, sand, dirt, moss, and small gravel. The transformable wheel robot presented in this paper is able to overcome obstacles and navigate these dynamics surfaces, yet can still move quickly over flat ground. The wheel is comprised of five spokes or legs, four of which are actively driven by a motor via four slider-crank linkages. The last one is designed be passive in order to significantly decrease the actuation force of the transformer mechanism. Analysis shows that the maximum driving force required to actuate the passive leg design is 1/187.5 times that of the active leg design. Experiments demonstrate that the passive leg design allows the mobile robot to open the transformation mechanism with a maximum external loading of 1.809 times the original robot weight. The diameter of the legged configuration wheel is 1.576 times that of the circled configuration.},

Three methods were developed and tested: variations of Shape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM), “desktop” Smart Composite Microstructure Fabrication (SCM), and a novel 3D printing process. The SDM based approach produced precise patterns but was limited to a work area of 60 mm by 60 mm. The 3D printed method created laminates with approximately 6.5 times the load bearing capacity of cardstock with an estimated fatigue life of 106 cycles. The variation of the SCM process carried approximately 8 times more load than card-stock. A small prototype robot was built to demonstrate the robustness of the manufacturing methods using a novel deformable origami wheel inspired by the para-cylinder fold pattern. Four deformable wheels on the chassis were able to function as the transmission, steering mechanism, and suspension of the robot.},

ABSTRACT={This paper introduces SNUMAX, the grand winner of the RoboSoft Grand Challenge. SNUMAX was built to complete all the tasks of the challenge. Completing these tasks required robotic compliant components that could adapt to variable situations and environments and generate enough stiffness to maintain performance. SNUMAX has three key components: transformable origami wheels, a polymer-based variable stiffness manipulator, and an adaptive caging gripper. This paper describes the design of these components and how they worked together to allow the robot to perform the contest’s navigation and manipulation tasks.}

abstract={This paper reports on the design, integration, and performance evaluation of a novel four-leg/four-wheel transformable mobile robot, Quattroped. In contrast to most hybrid platforms that have separate mechanisms and actuators for wheels and legs, this robot is implemented with a unique transformation mechanism that directly switches the morphology of the driving mechanism between the wheels (i.e., a full circle) and 2 degrees of freedom leg (i.e., combining two half circles as a leg), so that the same system of actuation power can be efficiently utilized in both wheeled and legged modes. The design process, mechatronics, software infrastructure, behavioral development, and leg-wheel dynamic characteristics are described. The performance of the robot is evaluated in various scenarios, including driving and turning in wheeled mode, driving, step and bar crossing, irregular terrain passing, and stair climbing in legged mode. Taking advantage of the leg-wheel combination on a single platform, the comparison of the wheeled and legged locomotion is also discussed.},

abstract = {Many robotic systems experience fluctuating dynamics during their lifetime. Variations can be attributed in part to material degradation and decay of mechanical hardware. One approach to mitigating these problems is to utilize an adaptive controller. For example, in model-free adaptive control (MFAC) a controller learns how to drive a system by continually updating link weights of an artificial neural network (ANN). However, determining the optimal control parameters for MFAC, including the structure of the underlying ANN, is a challenging process. In this paper we investigate how to enhance the online adaptability of MFAC-based systems through computational evolution. We apply the proposed methods to a simulated robotic fish propelled by a flexible caudal fin. Results demonstrate that the robot is able to effectively respond to changing fin characteristics and varying control signals when using an evolved MFAC controller. Notably, the system is able to adapt to characteristics not encountered during evolution. The proposed technique is general and can be applied to improve the adaptability of other cyber-physical systems.},
