\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

UGVs are becoming more prevalent. Likewise, their envisioned environments are becoming more dynamic and varied.
%
We have evolved a UGV so that it is better able to handle obstacles of varying sizes.
%
Specifically, we compared and analyzed FSM and ANN controllers with and without obstacles in the environment.
%
Comparing these two techniques enabled us to propose a new hybrid controller that incorporates the advantages of both.
%
Although a direction controller was straightforward to optimize, the complex dynamics associated with climbing over obstacles makes it more difficult to design a controller for extending the Adabot' struts.
%
Our future work will focus on optimizing the hybrid controller and investigating different techniques for extending the struts.


% Talk about more complex neural networks (recurrent, hidden nodes, etc.).

% More complex tasks (sequential tasks lexicase).
